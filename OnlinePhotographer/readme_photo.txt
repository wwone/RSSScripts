This folder contains the script for reading the
RSS feed of "The Online Photographer". In addition to
the "wget" command, this script needs the runtime "java"
command.

It uses the "ReadXMLDOM.class" executable, which can
be found in the "ChicagoBoyz" folder. The "java" folder
contains the source java for that program, if you wish to
compile it yourself.
