To run this script, you will need to have compiled the ReadXMLDOM program. See the "java" folder for 
source and script to compile.

This script assumes that the compiled object "ReadXMLDOM.class" is in the current
directory.

This script assumes that the "wget" and "java" commands are available on your Linux/Unix
system. It is also expected that the "javac" compilation command was needed to
compile the Java code.
